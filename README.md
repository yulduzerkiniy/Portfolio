# Data Science Portfolio
### Hi there! I'm Yulduz! I tried to share my most different Data Science projects.
#### In this page you will see the explanation and some conclusions and results.
#### At the end of each project there's a link to siyrce code

## Project 1. School students final grade prediction
#### This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por).

## A description of what the project is for.

This should answer a short list of basic questions:

* **What is this repo or project?** (You can reuse the repo description you used earlier because this section doesn’t have to be long.)
* **How does it work?**
* **Who will use this repo or project?**
* **What is the goal of this project?**  

You likely have the answer to many of these questions in your head and have discussed them with your team. It's helpful to write them down for people who find your repository. Not only will it be easier for developers to know how to fork the project or become involved with the project, but it will be easy for non-coders to understand what the code is designed to do, and how they, too, can become involved.

**Example:** The [README for 18F’s Midas project](https://github.com/18f/midas) starts out by answering the questions:

* What is Midas?
* How does Midas work?
* Who uses Midas?
* What is Midas’ goal?
* How can your organization benefit from using Midas?
